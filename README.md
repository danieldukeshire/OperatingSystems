# OperatingSystems

This repository is to showcase the topics learned throughout the course of CSCI 4210: Operating Systems.

Purpose of this course:
Discussion of various aspects of computer operating systems design and implementation. Topics include I/O programming,
concurrent processes and synchronization problems, process management and scheduling of processes, virtual memory
management, device management, file systems, deadlock problems, system calls, and interprocess communication. 
Programming projects are required.

Learning objectives:
Demonstrate the ability to compare, contrast, and apply concepts
of both classic and modern operating systems

Analyze operating systems by designing and implementing both
analytical and simulation models, the latter via a programming
language

Implement specific operating system constructs in C on a Linux
platform to create real-world systems-level programs and
applications
